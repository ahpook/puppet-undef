puppet-undef
============


This is a little module intended to sum up all the code examples
and use cases around the Puppet parser, DSL, and template handling's
uses of things which are undefined (and its various synonyms).

The `manifests/` directory contains extracted code samples from the
redmine bugs related to the umbrella bug [#15329](https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/15329),
on which Jeff McCune did yeoman service, aggregating there all the 
various branches and offshoots of the problem.
